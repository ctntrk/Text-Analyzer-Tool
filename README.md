# üìù **Text Analyzer Tool** üìä

The **Text Analysis Tool** is a simple web application that allows users to input their text and get various statistical insights in real-time. By pasting a block of text into the interface, users can instantly see key metrics such as character count, word count, sentence count, unique words, and paragraph count.

This project uses **Streamlit** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend, working together to provide a smooth user experience with instant results.

## üìÑ **Project Overview**

This application is designed to offer quick and accurate text analysis through a simple and interactive web interface. It allows users to gain insights into the structure and complexity of any given text, such as the total number of characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, and distinct words.

* **Streamlit** is used to create a clean and interactive user interface, where users can easily input their text and see results in real time.
* **Flask** serves as the backend to process and analyze the text, returning the statistical data to the frontend.

This project is perfect for anyone who wants to analyze the basic statistics of their text quickly and effortlessly. It can be particularly useful for writers, students, and educators who need to evaluate their content.

## üí° **How to Use**

1. **Paste Your Text**: Start by pasting your text into the input area on the Streamlit interface.
2. **Click "Analyze"**: Once your text is entered, click the **"Analyze"** button to view the statistical breakdown.
3. **Click "Clear"**: You can reset the input and start fresh by clicking the **"Clear"** button.

## üîß **Technical Setup**

### **Frontend: Streamlit**

The frontend of this application is built using **Streamlit**, a Python library that allows for the rapid creation of interactive web applications. The interface allows users to enter text, click the "Analyze" button to view results, and interact with the application.

* **Input Text**: Users can paste text into a text area.
* **Analyze Button**: Triggers an HTTP request to the backend Flask API to process the text and retrieve statistics.
* **Clear Button**: Clears the input area for a fresh start.

### **Backend: Flask**

The backend is built with **Flask**, a micro web framework for Python. Flask handles HTTP POST requests and performs the text analysis, returning a JSON response with the statistics to the frontend.

* **Text Processing**: The backend processes the input text to calculate metrics such as character count, word count, sentence count, unique words, and paragraph count.
* **API**: The backend exposes a POST API at `/count` that receives the text and returns the computed statistics.
